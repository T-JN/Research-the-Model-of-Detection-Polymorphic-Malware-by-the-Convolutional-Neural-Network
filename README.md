Research the Model of Detection Polymorphic Malware by the Convolutional Neural Network

The following malware was used: abc, cheeba, december_3, stasi, otario, dm, v-sign, tequila, flip. 
The research was conducted in a software-defined network based on the Windows Server 2016 Standard operating network with the Hyper-V role installed (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2016), 
OS Ubuntu 21.04 is chosen as the execution environment (https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=22.04&architecture=amd64). 
Software development was carried out in IDE CLion (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/configuring-available-python-interpreters.html).
Also in the virtual environment, a test network was deployed with the pfSense (https://www.pfsense.org/download/) distribution kit with the Snort&Suricata intrusion 
detection system installed with the latest updates, to compare the results.
